Examples for built-in Python modules.

I think one the best ways to learn is through examples. In this repository I will try to write the simplest examples for built in Python modules. 
This going to take sometime and I appreciate any help and comments. I will be very happy if these examples help at least one person :).

Files structure:
Folder names - Python modules
File names - Module function names or just numbers
